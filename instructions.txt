:::: GeoGrapher version 1.0 ::::

Function grapher which can change over time. Quick start Guide:

Two-Windows:
1.) text prompts and control center
2.) graph window


Menus:
1.) Functions
2.) Window
3.) Manual


:::::::::::: FUNCTIONS MENU ::::::::::::

--> Equations: main feature of GeoGrapher. Allows the user to edit the
    current equations displayed in the graph window. Equations are
    parametric, meaning both X and Y equations need to be entered. Both
    equations depend on variable "n". Main operations are (+,-,*,/,^).
    **Sample expression: "(4*n) - (1/3)*n^2 + 1"** 
    Can also add variable "t" to either or both equations in order to 
    develop the curve over time.
    **Sample expression: "(4*t*n) - (1/3)*n^2 + 1 + t"** 
    Finally, the user can make use of many built-in functions and 
    constants. (See function catalog for full list).
    **Sample expression: "cos(pi*n) + sin(n+t)^2"**
    
--> N-Range: allows user to edit the range over which the variable n
    varies, as well as the step size. Can make use of built-in
    functions and constants, but not variables.
    
--> T-Range: allows user to edit the range over which the variable t
    varies, as well as the step size. Can make use of built-in
    functions and constants, but not variables.
	
:::::::::::: WINDOW MENU ::::::::::::

--> Grids: allows user to edit the grid range and frequency of tick
    marks. Can make use of built-in functions and constants, but not
    variables
    
--> Circle: can edit radius of drawn circle (turned off by default, 
    see option menu to turn on)
	
--> Colors: allows user to edit colors of graph

--> Options: can toggle showing grids and circle, and edit speed of
    update frame rate
	
	
:::::::::::: MANUAL ::::::::::::

--> Instructions: can view the quick start guide (this!)

--> Function Catalog: can view the function catalog
